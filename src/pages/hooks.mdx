# Hooks

Many of the components are really just thin wrappers over data exposed by nouns builder contracts. If you are a dev that would prefer to fetch this data yourself so you have complete control over your markup, builder-bundle exposes hooks that let you fetch right into this data and skip over any sort of components. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Full demo coming soon. {{ className: 'lead' }}
