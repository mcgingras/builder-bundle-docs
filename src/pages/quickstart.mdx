# Quickstart

Make sure you have have builder bundle installed in your project. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<CodeGroup>
```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
# Install builder bundle
npm install builder-bundle
```
</CodeGroup>

## Wrap with the provider

Builder bundle needs to be aware of your Nouns Builder contract addresses. Wrapping your project in the builder bundle `BuilderProvider` allows builder bundle hooks and components to easily read from your contracts. To start, wrap the root of your project with `BuilderProvider`. It should look something like this.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript {{ language: 'js' }}
const BUILDER_COLLECTION_ADDRESS = "YOUR-COLLECTION-ADDRESS";
const BUILDER_AUCTION_ADDRESS = "YOUR-AUCTION-ADDRESS";
const BUILDER_GOVERNOR_ADDRESS = "YOUR-GOVERNOR-ADDRESS";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <BuilderProvider
      collectionAddress={BUILDER_COLLECTION_ADDRESS}
      auctionAddress={BUILDER_AUCTION_ADDRESS}
      governorAddress={BUILDER_GOVERNOR_ADDRESS}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </BuilderProvider>
  )
}
````
</CodeGroup>



## Using your first component

Once you've wrapped your app with the `BuilderProvider` you can start using the components.
Here's an example of using the `ActiveAuction.Countdown` component. As you can see, the component itself is unstyled, but when combined with tailwind (or any CSS you would like!) you can get some amazing results.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript {{ language: 'js' }}
import { ActiveAuction } from 'builder-bundle';

<div className="flex flex-col">
  <label className="text-gray-400">Auction ends in</label>
  <ActiveAuction.Countdown className="text-xl" />
</div>
````

</CodeGroup>
