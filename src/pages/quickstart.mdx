  'This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Protocol API. Weâ€™ll cover how to get started an API client and how to make your first API request.'

# Quickstart

Make sure you have have builder bundle installed in your project. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
# Install builder bundle
npm install builder-bundle
```

</CodeGroup>

## Wrap with the provider

Builder bundle needs to be aware of your Nouns Builder contract addresses. Wrapping your project in the builder bundle `BuilderProvider` allows builder bundle hooks and components to easily read from your contracts. To start, wrap the root of your project with `BuilderProvider`. It should look something like this.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript {{ language: 'js' }}
const BUILDER_COLLECTION_ADDRESS = "YOUR-COLLECTION-ADDRESS";
const BUILDER_AUCTION_ADDRESS = "YOUR-AUCTION-ADDRESS";
const BUILDER_GOVERNOR_ADDRESS = "YOUR-GOVERNOR-ADDRESS";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <BuilderProvider
      collectionAddress={BUILDER_COLLECTION_ADDRESS}
      auctionAddress={BUILDER_AUCTION_ADDRESS}
      governorAddress={BUILDER_GOVERNOR_ADDRESS}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </BuilderProvider>
  ) 
}
````
</CodeGroup>



## Using your first component

Once you've wrapped your app with the `BuilderProvider` you can start using the components.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/conversations">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -d limit=10
````

```js
import ApiClient from '@example/protocol-api'

const client = new ApiClient(token)

await client.conversations.list()
```


</CodeGroup>



## What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the Protocol API:
