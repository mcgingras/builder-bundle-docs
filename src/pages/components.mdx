# Components

The recommended way to interact with the builder bundle is by using the component library. Components are totally unstyled and are thin wrappers over data that is exposed by the Nouns Builder contracts. The goal is to leave the styling totally in the hands of the developers consuming components from builder bundle. Combine these components with your favorite CSS library. {{ className: 'lead' }}
